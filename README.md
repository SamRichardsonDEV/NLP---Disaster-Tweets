# NLP---Disaster-Tweets

This project shows two seperate approaches to the KAGGLE NLP task for Disaster Tweets, one utilising BERT and a Neural Network and another utilising a Support Vector Machine with TF-IDF and lemmitization.

Between both approaches, the SVM delivers higher levels of accuracy at 79.99% when compared to the NN's 75.2%. If the features engineered in each notebook were to be utilised however, it is likely these accuracy scores could be further improved, so if I decide to return to this project that is what I will do.

This was my first attempt utilising both of these technologies, with BERT proving to be particularly challenging, I am welcome to suggestions to improve this, as the accuracy score obtained from the NN is significantly lower than what is achievable from BERT + CNN.

(Training the Neural Network takes a significant amount of time, hence why Kaggle's notebook was later used to perform training operations, and why accuracy metrics are not available in the notebook).
